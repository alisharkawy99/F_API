Weather API Interaction Project

Description:

This project is designed to interact with a Weather API, providing users with real-time weather data based on their input. The project uses an external API to fetch weather information such as temperature, weather conditions, and more.

Requirements:

API Authentication: The only requirement to interact with the Weather API is authentication. You will need an API key to access the data, which can be obtained by signing up for the API provider's service.
